# #Temperature-controller
This project is a Temperature Controller System built using an Arduino, DHT11 temperature sensor, and a motor (or fan) driver module. The system continuously monitors the surrounding temperature using the DHT11 sensor and automatically changes the fan speed and heater On/OFF on preset temperature conditions to keep the room temperature normal.
#  Temperature Controller using Arduino

##  #Overview
This project is a **Temperature Controller System** built using an **Arduino**, **DHT11 temperature sensor**, and a **motor (or fan) driver module**.  
It continuously monitors the ambient temperature and automatically controls a **heater (LED)** and **fan speed** based on the temperature range.  
The system also displays real-time temperature and humidity on an **LCD screen**.

##  #Features
- Real-time **temperature and humidity monitoring** using DHT11 sensor  
- **Automatic fan speed control** (Low / Medium / High)  
- **Heater (LED)** turns ON when temperature falls below 27°C  
- **LCD display** for live temperature and humidity readings  
- Simple, cost-effective, and easy to build project

##  #Working Principle
1. The **DHT11 sensor** measures the surrounding temperature and humidity.  
2. The Arduino reads this data and checks the temperature range.  
3. Based on the temperature, the system automatically controls the **heater (LED)** and **fan speed** using the motor driver.

### # Temperature Control Logic
| Temperature Range | Action | Description |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| Below **27°C** | Heater (LED) ON | Indicates heating mode (cold condition) |
| **27°C – 29°C** | Fan ON (Low Speed) | Mild cooling |
| **30°C – 32°C** | Fan ON (Medium Speed) | Moderate cooling |
| Above **32°C** | Fan ON (High Speed) | Maximum cooling |

4. The **LCD display** continuously shows real-time temperature and humidity readings.
