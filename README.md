# Temperature-controller
This project is a Temperature Controller System built using an Arduino, DHT11 temperature sensor, and a motor (or fan) driver module. The system continuously monitors the surrounding temperature using the DHT11 sensor and automatically turns ON/OFF the motor or fan based on preset temperature conditions.
